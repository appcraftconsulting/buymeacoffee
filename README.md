## App Store Review 

These are the two App Store Review Guidelines articles you have to know before using this framework:

[3.1.1 In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase)
> - Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to ‚Äútip‚Äù digital content providers in the app.

[3.2.1 Acceptable](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#acceptable):
> **(vii)** Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.

## Implement Buy Me a Coffee

1. Import the BuyMeACoffee framework in your `UIApplicationDelegate`:
```swift
import BuyMeACoffee
```
2. Configure the `BMCManager` shared instance with the username you've chosen on www.buymeacoffee.com, typically in your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:
```swift
BMCManager.shared.configure(username: "appcraftstudio")
```
3. In the view controller, override the `viewDidLoad` method to set the presenting view controller of the `BMCManager` object.
```swift
BMCManager.shared.presentingViewController = self
// You can also set a custom thank you message
BMCManager.shared.thankYouMessage = "Thank you for supporting üéâ App Craft Studio !"
```
4. Add a `BMCButton` to your storyboard, XIB file, or instantiate it programmatically. To add the button to your storyboard or XIB file, add a View and set its custom class to `BMCButton`.
5. **Optional**: If you want to customize the button, do the following:
```swift
let configuration = BMCButton.Configuration(color: .orange, font: .cookie)
let button = BMCButton(configuration: configuration)
// or set the burtton configuration later
button.configure(with: configuration)
```

## (Optional) Configure In-App Purchase

Depending the legal receiver of the gift configured on Buy Me a Coffee, App Store reviewers can ask for In-App Purchase implementation.  
If the following In-App Purchase if configured for your application, it will be displayed as primary flow when user tap on the `BMCButton`.

**If the framework can't retrieve In-App Purchase informations, the web flow will be used as fallback.**
